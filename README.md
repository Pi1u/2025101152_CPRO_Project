====HOW TO COMPILE====

please try running it on windows for I have not enabled some of the features of this project for linux yet

you can compile by typing- "gcc -o app main.c board.c" in the command prompt



things I am about to add-

1> allowing players to enter their own name and the color they want to play with

2> making it so that games can be saved and loaded

3> adding the code to detect winning condition

4> writing the code to check for links and run logics on the data
